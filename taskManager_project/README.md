## Description

This task manager/viewer is primarily meant for productivity-oriented students and office workers with multiple
tasks to keep track of, although anyone may use it as a *to-do list*. It highlights current progress not only 
as a means of motivation and creating feelings of accomplishment, but also as a subtle yet constant reminder of the
task at hand to create an appropriate balance of encouragement and pressure. I find it easier to be motivated and 
work more efficiently when I am aware of my progress, and hope to be able to use and improve this application over time.
